Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music. Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

Slide 1
What is the total number of times each movie was rented by film category?

Query 1
SELECT f.title AS film_name, cat.name AS category_name, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM rental AS r
JOIN inventory AS i
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film AS f
ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN film_category AS fm
ON fm.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN category AS cat
ON cat.category_id = fm.category_id AND cat.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family','Music')
GROUP BY film_name, category_name
ORDER BY category_name;



Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Slide 2
What is the count of rental by category and by quarter?

Query 2
SELECT film_name, category_name, rental_period, NTILE (4) OVER (ORDER BY rental_period) AS std_quartile
FROM
	(SELECT f.title AS film_name, cat.name AS category_name, 
	f.rental_duration AS rental_period 
	FROM film AS f
	JOIN film_category AS fm
	ON fm.film_id = f.film_id
	JOIN category AS cat
	ON cat.category_id = fm.category_id AND cat.name 
	IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family','Music')
	GROUP BY film_name, category_name,rental_period)table1
ORDER BY rental_period;



Question 3
Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns: Category, Rental length category, Count

Slide 3
What is the total number of movies by category and by quarter?

Query 3
SELECT category_name, std_quartile, COUNT(*) AS count_of_movies
FROM
	(SELECT f.title AS film_name, cat.name AS category_name, f.rental_duration, 
	NTILE (4) OVER (ORDER BY rental_duration) AS std_quartile
	FROM film AS f
	JOIN film_category AS fm
	ON fm.film_id = f.film_id
	JOIN category AS cat
	ON cat.category_id = fm.category_id AND cat.name 
	IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy','Family','Music'))table1 
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;



Question 4
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

Slide 4
What is the rental count for each store by month and by year?

Query 4
SELECT DATE_PART('month',r.rental_date) rental_month,
	DATE_PART('year',r.rental_date) rental_year, 
	s.store_id,COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM rental AS r
JOIN staff AS st 
ON r.staff_id = st.staff_id
JOIN store AS s 
ON s.store_id = st.store_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 4 DESC;
